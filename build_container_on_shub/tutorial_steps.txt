#Create a github a account if you don't already have one. Go to:
#https://github.com/join
#{Remember your username and password!}

#Use a text editor to explore and customize the recipe file ‘Singularity’:

nano Singularity

	#Can you determine the purpose of each section?
	#Can you determine what this container does?  
	#Are there any files copied to the container?
	#Now change the ‘Maintainer’ to your name
	#To exit and save type [ctrl-x], then “y”, then [enter].

 #Now we are ready to build a container on Singularity Hub using this recipe. Recall that we do this by creating a github repository containing the ‘Singularity’ recipe file.  For the sake of time we’ve created a script to facilitate this step. Type:

./make_git_repo.sh <your-github-username>

#You will be prompted for your github password 2 times while the script is running; enter it each time.  User your browser to confirm your repository was created:

https://github.com/<your-github-username>/build_container_on_shub

#Now navigate to Singularity Hub in your browser:

https://www.singularity-hub.org/

…and do the following:
1. Go to the "login" link in the upper right corner and login with your github credentials
2. Choose "GITHUB", not "GITHUB (WITH PRIVATE)"
3. Go to "My container collections”
4. Go to "Add a Collection”
4. Choose "<your-github-username>/build_container_on_shub" and click on "SUBMIT”
6. This will take you another page while your container builds.  You can click "refresh" to check it's status.  It may take several minutes. 
7. If your container builds successfully, you will see a green ‘Complete’ button.  If not, let us know and we’ll help: you can quickly fix and re-commit the recipe to github, which will initiate another build on Singularity Hub.

#Now navigate to Singularity Hub in your browser:

singularity pull --name mytranslator.img shub://<your-github-username>/build_container_on_shub

#Run your container with the ‘inside’ version of the python script:

singularity run mytranslator.img 

#…and run your container with the ‘outside’ version of the python script:

singularity exec mytranslator.img python ./text_translate.py

#(hint: you can change the language in ./text_translate.py to confirm that the outside script is running)
