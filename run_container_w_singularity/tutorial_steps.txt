#Try the following:

# Pull an existing container image that someone else posted:
singularity pull --name hello.img shub://monaghaa/singularity_git_tutorial

# …And run it:
singularity run hello.img

# …And look at the script inside:
singularity exec hello.img cat /code/hello.sh

# Now let’s grab the stock docker python container:
singularity pull --name pythond.img docker://python

# …And run python from it:
singularity exec pythond.img python

# …And shell into the container and look around:
singularity shell pythond.img

# …try “ls /” What directories do you see?:

#Let’s run an external python script using the containerized version of python:
#First create a script called “myscript.py” as follows:
echo 'print("hello world from the outside")' >myscript.py

#…And now let’s run the script using the containerized python
#singularity exec pythond.img python ./myscript.py

#…Conclusion: Scripts and data can be kept inside or outside the container.  
#In some instances (e.g., large datasets or scripts that will change frequently) 
#it is easier to containerize the software and keep everything else outside.

#On Summit, most host directories are “bound” (mounted) by default. 
#But on other systems, or in some instances on Summit, 
#you may want to access a directory that is not already mounted.  
#Let’s try it:

#Note that the “/opt” directory in ”pythond.img” is empty.  
#But the Summit ”/opt” directory is not.  Let’s bind it:
singularity shell –bind /opt:/opt pythond.img

#Now from within the container type "ls -l /opt" and see if it matches
#what you see from the outside of the container if you type the same thing.

# …It isn’t necessary to bind like-named directories like we did above. 
#Try binding your /home/$USER directory to /opt. 
singularity shell –bind /home/$USER:/opt pythond.img

#Now from within the container type "ls -l $HOME" and see if it matches
#what you see from the outside of the container if you type the same thing.

# ***Note: If your host system does not allow binding, 
#you will need to create the host directories you want mounted 
#when you build the container (as root on, e.g., your laptop)
